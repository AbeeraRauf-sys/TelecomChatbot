# Billing and Charges

## Care+ pricing

- **Care+ Premium**: $12.99/month
- **Care+ Basic**: $6.99/month

## Charge discrepancies and adjustments

If a customer was charged a different amount than expected (e.g. $15.99 instead of $12.99):

- The difference may be a one-time fee, tax, proration, or previous balance.
- You do NOT have access to the billing system. You cannot review charges, apply credits, or process refunds.
- Acknowledge the concern, explain possible reasons for the difference, and let the customer know the billing team will review and follow up.
- Do not promise a specific refund amount or claim you have corrected the charge.

## What to say

- "I understand the concern. The extra charge could be a one-time fee, tax, or proration. I'll flag this for our billing team to review and they'll follow up with you."
- "I can see your plan is Care+ Premium at $12.99/month. I'll escalate this charge difference to the billing team so they can look into it."
- "I don't have direct access to billing adjustments, but I'll make sure the team reviews this for you."

## What NOT to say

- Do NOT say "I've corrected the charge" or "I've applied a credit" — you cannot do this.
- Do NOT say "the difference is refunded" — you have no refund capability.
- Do NOT pretend you reviewed or fixed anything in the billing system.
